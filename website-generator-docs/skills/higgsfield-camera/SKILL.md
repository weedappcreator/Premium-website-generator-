## Combining Camera Controls

Layering two compatible movements creates richer shots:

| Combination | Effect | Example |
|-------------|--------|---------|
| Dolly In + Dutch Angle | Closing tension + instability | Villain reveal |
| Crane Up + 360 Orbit | Epic reveal of scale + isolation | Final battle end |
| FPV Drone + Crash Zoom In | Kinetic energy + sudden focus | Chase climax |
| Handheld + Action Run | Raw realism + pursuit urgency | Escape sequence |

**Avoid conflicting moves:** Don't combine Dolly In with Dolly Out, or Crane Up with Crane Down in the same shot — it creates visual contradiction.

**Sequenced vs simultaneous combinations.** The table above lists *simultaneous* combinations (two motions happening at once). Production practice also uses *sequenced* combinations: pan to follow the character through phase one, then push-in on the face when the character stops. State the sequence with timing in the prompt — `Camera pans left from 0-3s tracking the character, holds, then pushes in on the face from 4-8s` — so the model renders the motions as discrete phases rather than collapsing them into a single ambiguous move.

**Static pan vs glide.** A camera that *pans* rotates from a fixed position; a camera that *glides* translates through space. Production practice prefers static-pan over glide for most coverage — the static-pan reads as a chosen viewpoint with directed attention, the glide reads as untethered. State which you mean: `the camera stays in position and pans to follow him` is distinct from `the camera glides alongside him as he walks`.

## Camera-Emotion Sync — Movement per Focal Character Emotion

The camera is the emotional double of the focal character.
Movement, lens choice, and shot duration should be picked by the
character's emotional state — not by what looks "cinematic" in the
abstract. The mismatch is one of the most visible tells of an
AI-video prompt that hasn't done the emotional-syncing work: a
calm scene with a jittery handheld camera reads as wrong even when
nothing else is broken; an angry scene with a smooth dolly reads
as detached even when the action is right.

Six emotional registers cover most scenes:

| Focal character emotion | Camera prescription |
|---|---|
| Anger / rage / tension / on edge | Handheld breathing, jittery and unstable — broken breath rhythm, visible micro-twitches in both axes, small amplitude, irregular rhythm. Avoid stabilizers. |
| Calm / control / confidence | Handheld breathing, smooth — steady breath rate, regular micro-amplitude. Stabilizer-light, but still alive. |
| Sadness / vulnerability | Handheld, slow, low — lower breath frequency, slight downward camera drift, weight feels heavier on the operator. |
| Shock / revelation | Static + very slow push-in or pull-out — sharp freeze at the moment of revelation, then minimal movement for the next 0.5-2s. |
| Action | 60fps, 180° shutter — clean motion with shutter-bound motion blur; avoid pulled motion blur from longer shutters. |
| Final beat / verdict | Top-shot freeze, 0.3-0.5s — directly from above, time stops, all positions locked. |
| Emotional breakdown / character needs space | Slow pull-back from medium/close to wide — "leave the character alone." Production-team named technique for emotional moments (a character sobs, curls up, or otherwise needs to be witnessed-but-not-pressured); pulling the camera back gives the audience visual distance that registers as emotional space rather than abandonment. |

### Emotional arcs within a single shot

When the focal character's emotion *changes* across a continuous
take (e.g. rage → controlled in a single shot), the camera should
change synchronously. Write it as named phases in the prompt:

- Opening phase: prescribe the camera for the entry emotion
- Transition phase: describe how the camera character shifts
  (handheld amplitude reduces, drift settles, push-in slows)
- Closing phase: prescribe the camera for the exit emotion

The camera moves with the actor, not on its own clock.

> **Decompose the emotion before picking the camera.** The 6
> emotional registers above are tracked by *named* emotions (anger,
> calm, sadness, shock). If the user supplies a generic emotion
> ("surprised", "tense") the first step is decomposing it into a
> specific named register — see `../higgsfield-prompt/SKILL.md` §
> Generic-Emotion Decomposition for the "which kind of X?"

## Cinema Studio 3.0 Camera Best Practices (Business/Team Plan)

> These best practices apply to Cinema Studio 3.0's generation engine, available exclusively on **Business and Team plans**.

### The One-Move Rule

For any single shot, specify only **ONE primary camera move**. Do NOT stack multiple moves (e.g., dolly push + pan left + tilt up). This is the #1 cause of jitter, unwanted rotation, and failed generations.

**Wrong:** `Camera: dolly push forward while panning left and tilting up to reveal the skyline`
**Right:** `Camera: slow dolly push from medium shot to tight close-up over 8 seconds`

If you need multiple camera moves, break them into separate shots using Cinema Studio 3.0's Custom multi-shot mode.

### Genre-Based Camera Presets

| Genre | Primary Camera | Secondary | Avoid |
|-------|---------------|-----------|-------|
| Product / E-commerce | Orbit, slow push-in, static | Crane down reveal | Handheld, whip pan |
| Lifestyle / Social | Handheld, static, slow pan | Dolly alongside | Dutch angle, crash zoom |
| Drama / Narrative | Slow push-in, dolly pull-out, tracking | Crane up | Fast moves, snap zoom |
| Music Video | Whip pan, snap zoom, fast tracking | 360 orbit | Static (too boring) |
| Horror | Slow creep (dolly in), static hold, Dutch angle | Crane down | Fast tracking (breaks tension) |
| Action / Chase | FPV drone, tracking, handheld run | Crash zoom | Static, slow orbit |
| Landscape / Travel | Crane up, slow pan, drone flyover | Dolly out reveal | Handheld, tight shots |
| Comedy / Social | Static (deadpan), snap zoom | Whip pan | Slow dramatic moves |

### Reliable Phrasing Library

These phrases produce consistent, predictable results:

| Intent | Reliable Phrase |
|--------|----------------|
| No camera motion | `locked-off static camera, no movement` |
| Slow approach | `slow dolly push from medium shot to tight close-up over 8 seconds` |
| Follow subject | `handheld tracking following the subject, subtle shake, not chaotic` |
| Reveal scale | `crane shot rising from ground level to overhead` |
| Circle subject | `smooth 180-degree orbit at eye level, constant distance` |
| Dramatic zoom | `crash zoom from wide to extreme close-up on impact` |
| POV movement | `FPV camera weaving through the environment at walking pace` |

### Camera Transfer via @Video Reference

The safest way to achieve complex camera motion is to clone it from a reference:

```
Match the camera movement from @Video1. A dancer performs on a rooftop at sunset.
```

This bypasses the One-Move Rule because the model extracts camera data directly from the reference rather than interpreting text instructions.

### Dual Video Reference

Action reference and camera reference can come from DIFFERENT videos. Separate them clearly:

```
Reference @Video1 for the character's movement and choreography.
Reference @Video2 for camera movement only.
A martial artist performs a spinning kick in a dojo.
```

### Smart Mode (Cinema Studio 3.0)

Cinema Studio 3.0's "Smart" shot control delegates camera planning to the model. When you select Smart mode:

- The model auto-plans camera language based on the genre and scene description
- Trust it for genre-appropriate camera work — describe the **feeling** or **genre** rather than specific camera moves
- Best for: users who want professional-looking camera work without manual specification
- Override by switching to Custom multi-shot for per-scene camera control

**Smart mode prompt example:**
```
Genre: Drama. A woman sits alone at a café table, stirring her coffee absently.
She notices someone through the window and her expression shifts from sadness to surprise.
```
(No camera instruction needed — Smart mode will select genre-appropriate drama camera work.)

## Video Reference — What It Reads, and What It Can't

The repo documents `@Video` reference usage in several places (Camera Transfer above,
`higgsfield-motion` for action choreography, `higgsfield-style` for grade carryover,
`higgsfield-audio` for voice timbre, `higgsfield-cinema` for the Motion/Camera Sheet).
The capability boundary — what a video reference reads reliably, where it falls short,
and what it cannot do at all — is documented once here and applies across all those
use cases.

### What It Reads Reliably

A `@Video` reference reliably carries these properties from the source clip into the
generation:

- **World design** — the overall environment, set construction, lighting logic, color
  palette, atmosphere.
- **Material and texture** — how surfaces look (wet wood, rope, water behavior, fabric
  weight).
- **Physics and motion style** — how objects move, how water behaves, the weight and
  energy of action.
- **Camera character** — the overall feel of how the camera operates, its proximity to
  subjects, its movement vocabulary.
- **Production quality level** — high-budget vs. low-budget feel, the overall cinematic
  register.
- **Color grade** — tonal treatment, contrast, saturation level.
- **Weather and environmental conditions** — storm intensity, rain density, fog, light
  quality.

### What It Reads Less Reliably

These properties carry across inconsistently. Don't depend on them when designing the
prompt:

- **Frame-accurate action continuation** — asking the model to pick up exactly where
  the last frame ended is unreliable. The reference understands the energy and world of
  what was happening, not the precise final position of every element.
- **Exact character identity** — use an image reference for character identity locks,
  not a video reference. Video references read world and energy better than face or
  costume precision.
- **Specific dialogue or audio** — voice character can carry over but exact vocal
  performance is not guaranteed.

### Four Reference Patterns by Purpose

Make the reference's job explicit in the prompt. Pick the pattern that matches what you
want the reference to do:

| Purpose | Pattern |
|---|---|
| World continuity | `@Video1 — use for world continuity: same set construction, same lighting logic, same atmosphere, same production quality level` |
| Action energy continuity | `@Video1 — use for action energy continuity: same event still in progress, same intensity of impact, same physical weight and momentum` |
| Camera character + production feel | `@Video1 — use for camera character and production feel: same cinematic register, same operator presence, same overall quality` |
| Voice + performance style | `@Video1 — use for character voice and performance style: same vocal character, same delivery register, same performance energy` |

The pattern works because it tells the model which axis of the reference matters and
lets the rest of the prompt drive the new content.

### Hard Limits

These are not "less reliable" — they are things a video reference cannot do at all:

- **Cannot continue a specific action from the last frame.** If the reference clip
  ends on a wave hitting a ship, the new clip will not automatically start with that
  wave still hitting. The reference supplies world context; write the new clip's
  opening action from scratch.
- **Cannot override your prompt.** The reference informs the generation — it does not
  replace prompt instructions. Where prompt and reference conflict, the prompt
  generally wins on action and the reference wins on texture and world feel.
- **Cannot supply character identity alone.** Always pair a video reference with an
  image reference if character consistency matters.

### Load-Bearing Rule

**Prompt wins on action, reference wins on texture and world feel.** Write the prompt
for what happens; let the reference carry how it looks. Pair with an image reference
when character identity must hold.
