## Positioning Framework Structure

Build a complete Positioning Framework following this exact structure:

### 0. POSITIONING STATEMENT

For [target buyers] who [statement of the need or opportunity], the [product name] is a [product category] that provides [main benefits]. Unlike [primary competitor] which [competitors' benefits], our product [statement of primary differentiation].

**Constraints**: Keep to 3-4 sentences.

### 1. CUSTOMERS

**Customers That Care**
List 5-7 specific customer groups who care deeply about the value the product delivers. Describe them by role, needs, or motivations.

**Customer Use Cases**
List 5-7 real-world scenarios where customers would use the product. Be specific (e.g., "a startup founder building a GTM strategy" instead of just "marketing").

**Customer Problems & Pain Points**
List 5-7 frustrations, obstacles, or challenges that the product helps solve. Make them real and practical.

### 2. PRODUCT & OFFERING

**What are the product capabilities?**
List the main things customers can do with the product. Use action verbs.

**What are the product features?**
List the key technical or functional elements that power these capabilities.

**What are the product benefits?**
Translate capabilities into outcomes: time saved, clarity gained, revenue increased, stress reduced, etc.

**Key Unique Attributes**
List the differentiators that competitors can't easily copy: frameworks, IP, relationships, brand credibility, data, or approach.

**Embedded Value (and Proof)**
Show the evidence that the product works (e.g., metrics, adoption stats, testimonials, case studies).

**How does the product work?**
Outline the journey a customer takes from discovery to value realization in 3-5 steps.

**What does it look like?**
Describe visuals, formats, or deliverables customers interact with (e.g., templates, dashboards, newsletters, community, reports).

### 3. MARKET / PRODUCT CATEGORY / FRAME OF REFERENCE

**Market Category**
Identify 5-7 macro market categories (e.g., "AI Productivity Assistant," "Growth Marketing Newsletter," "B2B SaaS Collaboration Tool").

**Relevant Trends**
List 5-7 trends that make the product timely and important.

### 4. COMPETITIVE ALTERNATIVES

**If you didn't exist, what would customers use?**

- **Direct competitors** (same JTBD, same solution)
- **Secondary competitors** (same JTBD, different solution)
- **Indirect competitors** (different JTBD, conflicting solution)

For each direct competitor group, break them down into:
- **Local/National competitors** (operating in the same country or local market)
- **Regional competitors** (operating across a wider geography like Africa, Europe, or LATAM)
- **Global competitors** (operating internationally)

List 5-7 examples in each geography tier.

**How do these alternatives fall short for customers?**
For every competitor listed, explain in detail: what they offer, what they do well, why they ultimately fall short, which capability, feature, or benefit they fail to deliver.
