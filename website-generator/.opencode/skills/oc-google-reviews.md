# Google Reviews

Fetch Google Maps review data for any business using the [DataForSEO](https://dataforseo.com) API.

## Prerequisites

- **DataForSEO account** with `DATAFORSEO_LOGIN` and `DATAFORSEO_PASSWORD` environment variables

## Usage

### Single Business

```bash
curl -s -X POST "https://api.dataforseo.com/v3/business_data/google/my_business_info/live" \
  -u "${DATAFORSEO_LOGIN}:${DATAFORSEO_PASSWORD}" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '[{
    "keyword": "Business Name",
    "location_name": "City,State,Country",
    "language_code": "en"
  }]'
```

### Extract Key Data

From the API response, extract:
- **Business name** (`title`)
- **Rating** (`rating.value`) -- e.g., 4.2
- **Review count** (`rating.votes_count`) -- e.g., 677
- **Rating distribution** (`rating.rating_distribution`) -- breakdown by 1-5 stars
- **Address** -- full street address
- **Category** -- business type (e.g., "Car dealer", "Restaurant")
- **Website URL**

### Batch Mode

For comparing multiple businesses, loop through a list and collect results into a markdown comparison table:

| Business | Rating | Reviews | Category |
|----------|--------|---------|----------|
| Business A | 4.5 | 1,234 | Restaurant |
| Business B | 3.8 | 567 | Restaurant |

Add a 200ms delay between requests to avoid rate limits.

## Output Format

Return results as structured JSON for single lookups, or as a markdown table for batch comparisons. Always include:
- Business name
- Star rating
- Total review count
- Rating distribution (1-5 star breakdown)
- Address and category

## Location Format

Use the DataForSEO location format: `City,State/Province,Country`

Examples:
- `Vancouver,British Columbia,Canada`
- `Toronto,Ontario,Canada`
- `New York,New York,United States`
- `London,England,United Kingdom`

## Use Cases

- **Reputation audit** -- check a client's Google rating before a proposal
- **Competitor analysis** -- compare ratings across competing businesses
- **Local SEO** -- monitor Google Maps presence and review velocity
- **Due diligence** -- research businesses before partnerships

## Important Notes

- DataForSEO charges per API call -- be mindful with large batches
- The API returns the first matching business for the keyword + location
- Results are synchronous (returned immediately)
