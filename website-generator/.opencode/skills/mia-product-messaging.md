## Messaging Framework Structure

Build a complete Messaging Framework following this exact structure:

### Value Proposition

Craft 5-7 variations of a strong value proposition statement (10-20 words each) that highlight the core benefit and unique value the product delivers.

### Taglines

Generate multiple tagline options using these copywriting frameworks:

**Category Leadership** → [Superlative claim] + [Why it matters]
- Provide 3-5 options

**USP (Unique Selling Proposition)** → "We [do X] for [target persona] so they can [benefit]."
- Provide 3-5 options

**FAB (Feature → Advantage → Benefit)** → "[feature] → so that → [benefit]."
- Provide 3-5 options

**Emotional Appeal** → Tap into desires, fears, or aspirations.
- Provide 3-5 options

**Problem → Promise** → Show how you uniquely solve a customer problem.
- Provide 3-5 options

**Alliteration & Wordplay** → Short, rhythmic, and memorable.
- Provide 3-5 options

**Transformation-Based** → From [pain] → To [gain].
- Provide 3-5 options

### Audience

Briefly define the target persona: role, responsibilities, goals, motivations, and buying behavior. Include emotional drivers. Cover all possible audience segments.

### Elevator Pitch

Write 3 versions of a 1-2 sentence pitch that combines the value proposition, target persona, and one or two top benefits. Make it punchy and memorable.

### Long Description

Write 3 versions of a 100-200 word narrative that expands on the value prop, feature/benefit details, target audience, and proof points. Keep it simple, compelling, and free of jargon.

### Tone of Voice

List 3-5 adjectives that describe the ideal voice (e.g., conversational, punchy, supportive, confident). Show a "before and after" example of how the tone should shift.

### Outcomes

List 5-7 outcomes customers can achieve using the product (clarity, growth, efficiency, cost savings, etc.).

### Customer Requirements

List 2-3 non-negotiable factors the target audience needs to see before converting (e.g., affordability, proof of effectiveness, localized examples).

### Outcome Pillars

Identify 3 core pillars (1-3 words each) that reinforce the elevator pitch and act as proof anchors (e.g., Execution, Clarity, Community).

### Pain Points

List 3-5 customer pain points that directly connect to each of the outcome pillars. Each outcome pillar must have at least 3 pain points listed.

### Product/Feature Benefits

List 3-5 benefits that map to resolving each of the pain points listed above. Phrase them in outcome-focused terms. Each outcome pillar must have at least 3 product/feature benefits listed.

### Product/Feature Details

List 3-5 product details and capabilities that deliver the benefits for each of the benefits listed above. Make them tangible. Each outcome pillar must have at least 3 product/feature details listed.

### Proof Points

Provide 3-5 supporting facts that tie to each of the outcome pillars:
- Testimonials or case studies
- Metrics (growth, usage, engagement)
- Awards, press mentions, or expert endorsements
- Unique expertise, credibility, or traction

Each outcome pillar must have at least 3 proof points listed.

- Taglines: short, snappy, and under 10 words where possible
- Elevator pitch: max 2 sentences
- Long description: 100-200 words
- Each outcome pillar must have at least 3 of these listed separately: pain points, product/feature benefits, product/feature details, proof points
- Use en dashes (with spaces) for ranges or connections
- Use em dashes (without spaces) for breaks in thought
